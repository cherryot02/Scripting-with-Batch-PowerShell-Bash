# Linux Bash: Vulnerability Scan of the Local Network

Objective: Use Linux Bash to perform a vulnerability scan of the local network and automate it with a cron job.

Task:
1. Write a Bash script that:
   - Scans your local network to find open TCP ports and detects OS versions on each host.
   - Displays the results in a readable format on the screen.
   - consider using `nmap`.

2. Automation: Schedule this script to run daily at 4 pm using `cron`.
   - Edit the crontab with `crontab -e` and add a new cron job to run the script.
  

## Task 1
This really took my time, the script was not running because there some kind of error in my typing...<br>
so I did some simple nmap scanning first in the terminal. And then I used the leafpad. <br>
The one in leafpad was from ChatGPT for testing but it was complicated and so I tried a normal nmap syntax that includes the open ports and OS versions. Added echo to know where things stopped and go. <br>
Had to label from nmap --help so I couldnâ€™t forget what to use.

So this did not work the first time because, for some reason, when I saved it as a .sh, it converted to Windows style line endings. <br>
It was not recognizing that the spaces and line breaks and kept erroring. Also realized I mistyped the ip too. (From the ChatGPT sample)

I searched online and I needed to convert the file to unix base, which then worked.

verifying but it looks just like it, so I decreased the comments and it worked.
