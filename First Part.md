# Introduction
> Welcome to my very basic-looking script lab work. <br>

Before I get into it, I will do some introduction and list the things I used. <br><br>

This lab was done in virtual machines running in the Virginia Cyber Range so I could only really use the OS the was being used in class, <br> 
but you can very much run these in any recent systems.

We are mainly using:
<ol>
  <li>Windows 7 for Batch and PowerShell (This was our target system so we just used this anyway.) </li>
  <li>Kali Linux</li>
</ol>

>[!CAUTION]  
>Be careful though, because you have to know how what each line does, <br>
>if not, well you may have a keylogger now and you won't know it.<br>
>I'm kidding, but this warning applies to every script you'll find in the internet.

Main objectives of this lab:
<ul>
  <li>Develop skills in Windows Batch & PowerShell, and Linux Bash scripting.</li>
  <li>Practice network recon and system process monitoring.</li>
  <li>Set up automated tasks with cron on Linux.</li>
  <li>Work with commonly available AI assistants</li>
</ul>

You saw that right. <em>AI</em>. ü´¢ <br>
This may or may not be vibe scripting but you will find out. <br>
<br>

Alright kidding aside, these tasks were given in class and we are meant execute them ourselves <br>
So "using AI" was permitted but it did not really help me that much because it would output too many complicated stuff that was unneccessary.


# First Part: Windows Batch File - Local Network Ping Sweep

Write a Windows Batch file that: <br>
   - Loops through a range of IP addresses on your local network (e.g., `192.168.1.1` to `192.168.1.254`).
   - Pings each IP address once.
   - Displays reachable IP addresses on the screen.
> HINT: Use a `FOR` loop and the `ping` command to iterate through IP addresses.


## My Process and output
I had a bit of a hard time; I first tried and see what ChatGPT has to say but I did not understand the syntax and it did not output properly <br>
so I started to do it manually first to see if the normal commands are working.  <br>
I was not able to screenshot the first one and I learned that the comments for this ‚Äú::‚Äù and not ‚Äú#‚Äù.  <br><br>

I did realize that I wasn‚Äôt supposed to run this in the terminal and needed to use a text editior.<br><br>

Also pinged the linux machine which was reachable.<br>
So I then tried the script from the presentation(powerpoint) and adjusted some bits accordingly.<br>
At this point, I realized that I must use the notepad so this could run and save it as ‚Äúfilename.bat‚Äù‚Ä¶<br>
this was the result:<br><br>

So now, I‚Äôll do it with the instructions and instead of a separate file for the output, <br>
I will just echo it to the terminal. I did leave an else for the unreachable just to see, <br><br>

Only a few popped out alive and I did not wait for it to finish so I will remove the unreachable ones so it‚Äôs easier to see.

As soon as the Ping sweep was complete, the terminal closed. Replaced the word alive to ‚Äúreachable‚Äù for the instructions and changed timeout to -w 500 so it‚Äôs faster. <br><br>
