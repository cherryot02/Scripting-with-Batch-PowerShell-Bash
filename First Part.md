# Introduction
Welcome to my very basic-looking script lab work. <br>
Before I get into it, I will do some introduction and list the things I used. <br><br>

This lab was done in virtual machines running in the Virginia Cyber Range so I could only really use the OS the was being used in class, <br> 
but you can very much run these in any recent systems, just be careful though because you have to know how what each line does, <br>

Main objectives of this lab:
<ul>
  <li>Develop skills in Windows Batch & PowerShell, and Linux Bash scripting.</li>
  <li>Practice network recon and system process monitoring.</li>
  <li>Set up automated tasks with cron on Linux.</li>
  <li>Work with commonly available AI assistants</li>
</ul>

You saw that right. <em>AI</em>. ðŸ«¢ <br>
This may or may not be vibe scripting but you will find out.
