# Scripting-with-Batch-PowerShell-Bash
Wrote scripts that's meant to help with streamlining; using Windows Batch and PowerShell and Linux Bash.
This is all done in virtual machines.

This lab was done in virtual machines running in the Virginia Cyber Range so I could only really use the OS the was being used in class, <br> 
but you can very much run these in any recent systems.

## Tools Used
- Windows 7 for Batch and PowerShell (This was our target system so we just used this anyway.)
- Kali Linux for Bash


## Skills Learned
  - Develop skills in Windows Batch & PowerShell, and Linux Bash scripting.
  - Practice network recon and system process monitoring.
  - Set up automated tasks with cron on Linux.
  - Work with commonly available AI assistants.
